# Trimming pipeline

In this session we will design our first bash pipeline script and understand the results of running `fastp` on the quality of `FASTQ` files.

The tool we are going to use for trimming is called `fastp` <https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp> and the paper is [here](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty560)

**NOTE**: Please make a flow chart of the activites in this exercise. Understanding things visually is the key to effective scripting (programming).

We recommend that you

- Read through the entire exercise first
- Draw a flow-chart
- Then start executing these commands on the command line

## 1. Pre-trimming QC analysis

### 1.1 Setup conda in bash

**NOTE**: Before starting this exercise, please close all default terminals on Gitpod and then start a new terminal.

To "remind" Gitpod about `conda`, run the following commands on the shell

```bash
conda init bash 

exec $SHELL
```

### 1.2 Download the relevant datasets

```
wget ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR598/001/ERR5987181/ERR5987181_1.fastq.gz


wget ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR598/001/ERR5987181/ERR5987181_2.fastq.gz

```

### 1.3 Create a `qc-env` using `conda`

For this exercise, please refer to the content covered as part of `LearningCommandLine_2`

### 1.4 Generate the `fastqc` report for these samples

For this exercise, please refer to the content covered as part of `LearningCommandLine_2`

After this step, you should have the following files in your system

```bash
ERR5987181_1_fastqc.html
ERR5987181_1_fastqc.zip

ERR5987181_2_fastqc.html
ERR5987181_2_fastqc.zip
```

## 2. Post-trimming QC analysis

### 2.1 Create a `fastp-env` using `conda`

```bash
conda create --name fastp-env bioconda::fastp
```

### 2.2 Run fastp on the downloaded samples

```bash

fastp -i ERR5987181_1.fastq.gz  -o ERR5987181_1.trimmed.fastq.gz 


fastp -i ERR5987181_2.fastq.gz  -o ERR5987181_2.trimmed.fastq.gz 
```

### 2.3 Generate the `fastqc` report for these `trimmed` samples

For this exercise, please refer to the content covered as part of `LearningCommandLine_2`

After this step, you should have the following files in your system

```bash
ERR5987181_1.trimmed_fastqc.zip
ERR5987181_1.trimmed_fastqc.html

ERR5987181_2.trimmed_fastqc.zip
ERR5987181_2.trimmed_fastqc.html
```

## 3. Compare the QC results of pre/post trimming analysis using `multiqc`

### 3.1 Run `multiqc` on the reports generated by `fastqc`

```
multiqc ./
```

### 3.2 Run a web server using Python to visualize HTML files

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

You should see a notification on the bottom-left of the screen for this PORT, `A service is available on port 8000`, **click** on `Open Browser` and then select the `html` files.

**If you do NOT** see that notification, please navigate to another tab in your browser add `8000` to the beginning of your Gitpod URL, for example `8000-biosharpdotn-bioinfogitpod-ehsr91d5nlc.ws-eu43.gitpod.io/`

### 3.3 Choose the HTML files from the web server index page

You should now be able to see the generated HTML outputs
